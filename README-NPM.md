## Installing

Open terminal and run `npm install -g impossible-solitaire`.

## Playing

Just type `solitaire`.

This is a mouse based game.

Drag-and-Drop, Click and Double Click all work where appropriate.

Game options include choosing a scoring method (Standard, Vegas or None), the card draw mode (one card or three cards) and whether or not to keep cumulative score. 

Game comes with 5 color themes. Log feature allows any move in the game to be undone.

Game board is always centered and is also responsive, so it can be played on anything from a classic 24x80 terminal window to a full screen MacBook one.

All data persist when app is terminated.

Upon winning, the cards will do their thing ðŸ˜‰.

> App is meant to explore the limits of Impossible as an app framework and the Impossible Collection as a component library. Some implementation details and features may stray away from "the recommended best practices" just to prove a point. Totally worth it.
